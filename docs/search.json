    "text": "In September 2024, we planned a trip to cycle from Paris to Milan through the Alps. There were four of us including myself, Alyssa, Grant (who had just quit his job) and Wes (who was on sabbatical from his job). Our plan was to fly to Paris and then rent a van to transport ourselves and 4 bikes to Annecy, where we would start cycling through the Alps, to end in Milan. Scroll below for a day by day review of our trip. Some total stats from our trip.\n\n420 miles cycled\n27,000 feet of climbing\n30,000 pastries\n9,000 sandwiches\n7,000 pizzas\n4,000 glasses of wine\n1 bad food poisoning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/7/24 - SF to Paris\nDrove from Tahoe to the Bay Area and flew out of San Francisco airport to Paris on French Bee airlines. Alyssa has Covid, so she’s wearing a mask. We picked up the Charneaus’ New Zealand friend and gave her a ride to the airport. She has been visiting and built a 60-foot-high traffic cone at Burning Man..\n\n\n9/8/24 - Arrive in Paris\nArrived in Paris and so did our boxes full of bike gear. Walked around and got some delicious Chinese soup and noodles. Prices are comparable, if not less, than the U.S., $12.50 total for my meal. Tax and tip included. I picked up a bike I purchased at a local bike shop called Bicloune. Kona Rove 700. Ready to bike around Paris!\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n\n\n9/9/24 - Explore Paris on Bike\nWent to the Louvre. Impressive and large building. Lots of Greek/Roman statues, which I didn’t find too interesting. The art seemed to be mostly religious-inspired or portraits. We did see the Mona Lisa, but there was a crowd around it, so we couldn’t get within 20 feet. We saw some other famous sites, but many were walled off because of the Olympics, like the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame. The best part of Paris so far is the crazy bicycle scene and lively street cafes. Cyclists are bold—women in high heels and sequined dresses with no helmets ride in heavy traffic. Corner cafes with red awnings are everywhere, full of locals eating and drinking..\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n9/10/24 - Explore Paris on Bike\nSpent a good chunk of the day on the hill at Montmartre. I think this was the highlight of Paris for me. Great views of the city and lovely historical cobblestone streets. Picasso’s first studio was here, and Van Gogh spent time here as well. A little touristy but justified. We rode our bikes down the Champs-Élysées, which was crazy busy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n …\n…\n …\n…\n …\n\n …\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n\n\n9/11/24 - Van to Annecy via Fontainebleau\nRented a van with our four bikes and drove to Annecy through heavy rain. We stopped at Château de Fontainebleau, which was enjoyable. Beautiful palace with 800 years of history. We learned about Napoleon and his importance to France, even saw his tiny yet opulent bed. Arrived in Annecy and walked around in the pouring rain to find dinner. Ate heavy but delicious chicken in a melted cheese bowl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n…\n …\n\n\n\n9/12/24 - Cycle loop around Lake Annecy\nLearning French from a balcony in old town Annecy. Wherever you go there are house sparrows. Going to go for a bike ride around the lake today. Bike around Lake Annecy today including an optional climb up Col de Forclaz. Beautiful scenery and city. Maybe one of the more beautiful places I’ve been to in my life. We ate chocolate crepes in Forclaz amidst cool fall-like weather but with the sun peeking out and providing great views of the lake and valley. About 32 miles and 2800 feet of climbing. On the way back we had fromage and Jamon plate at a cycle cafe right off the bike path back to Annecy. I tried to order a Monaco red beer, but my French is poor, and they gave me a coffee instead. I think it’s mo-nay-poo? Need to improve my pronunciation. Our Airbnb in Annecy is stellar. It’s located in the historic old town up a steep cobblestone stairwell. The entrance to the place is cave-like, but the unit is modern. We have a very nice, attentive French host who showed us around. We were able to put our bikes in the “cellar,” which seems like an actual cellar where wine would age over hundreds of years. The canals and bridges of Annecy are beautiful, with the lake and mountains as a backdrop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n …\n …\n\n\n\n9/13/24 - Annecy to Sallanches\nBiked from Annecy to Sallanches, which was about 54 miles. There was some sun and rain. Mostly pavement but some gravel. Some walking our bikes through mud. From Annecy we took D12 through Entremont, and Grant rode the Grand Alps route. We arrived at Sallanches around 6:30, very ready to be done and get warm. There weren’t many good food options around the Ibis Budget hotel, so we ate some McDonald’s and got to bed early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n9/14/24 - Sallanches to Chamonix\nThe sun returned, and we had a nice morning biking from Sallanches into the Chamonix valley. Google Maps sent us on some unnecessary gravel, where we ended up in a one-eyed farmer’s driveway with lots of barking dogs. The farmer was very nice and waved us through. Beautiful ride with views of Mont Blanc on quiet roads next to the motorway. Our Airbnb is located in the heart of Chamonix, above a tasty local burger joint, Poco Loco. We decided to take the Flégère tram up and hike to Lac Blanc in the afternoon. After drinking a beer with a side of Genepi at a hut at the lake, we had to sprint down the trail to make the last tram down at the end of the day. We barely made the last tram, very sweaty from running and slightly buzzed from the drinks. Amazing day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n\n\n9/15/24 - Explore Chamonix\nSpent the day on the north side of the valley after getting tickets to take the Aguille du Midi. The two-part tram takes you to 12k feet and ascends 9k feet, which is the most vert of any tram in the world. We picked a great weather day, perfectly sunny and calm. At the top, there are multiple buildings with up-close lookouts of Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains. You can see the Matterhorn in the distance. There were many mountaineers and skiers starting or ending their adventures from this spot. Incredible steep and committing terrain. It was quite the scenery and experience. We decided to hike to Lac Bleu from the mid-station and then ended up hiking all the way down to Chamonix. 3.5k of descent. It’s very steep here. My legs are sore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/16/24 - Chamonix to Ackersand\nBig day riding from Chamonix all the way to Ackersand (above Visp). About 82 miles and 5k of vert. Met some Americans at Col de Forclaz who were hiking the Haute Route (sounds fun) from Boise and Spokane. Huge 5k descent into Martigny and then flat riding next to the Rhone River through Valais. Valais is quite industrial and agricultural, lots of construction going on. There were large excavators dumping big amounts of soil into the river. Maybe building a new bike path or train??? The river seems quite man-made and impacted. We picked some apples from local orchards, and they were amazing. Been eating pastries and bread for a week. We briefly were on Euro Velo 17, which was a nice gravel path along the river. I hope to explore more Euro Velos in the future and go to the annual conference! We didn’t have a place to stay, but we ended up booking a “guest house” above Visp in Ackersand. It was a B&B with a great host. We had access to the kitchen and common areas with secure bike parking. Classic Swiss wooden mountain aesthetic. It was a great find and likely the cheapest place we could have found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/17/24 - Zermatt\nTook the train to Zermatt $$$$$ from Stalden and spent the day hiking around the Matterhorn and exploring Zermatt. We decided to skip taking the gondola up and hiked about 3k to get to Schwarzee, where we had amazing views of the Matterhorn. It was quiet, peaceful, and one of my favorite moments of the trip yet. We had great weather. Staring at the Matterhorn felt like watching a screensaver in a dentist waiting room but in real life. Pretty amazing. We ate some delicious cheese fondue in Zermatt and observed all the older rich people that seem to frequent the town. Much wealthier and older vibe compared to the young outdoorsy vibe in Chamonix. Very pricey day but one of the most enjoyable days so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/18/24 - Ackersand to Ascona\nWe left our B&B guest house and rode our bikes over to Brig to catch the train to Domodossola. Wes and Grant are climbing Simplon Pass, but we decided to ride a train through it. In Domodossola, we had lunch, espresso, and some delicious pastries. It is a very charming town with good affordable food. Alyssa took the train from Domodossola to Re because her knee was hurting her. I rode alone and had a great ride. Steep difficult climb including a long portion in a tunnel. But once I got to the top, the ride was lovely. Malesca is a cute town with access to the Val Grande National Park. While waiting for the train, I got an espresso and lemon pie at a bar right under the big basilica. Quite a lovely day. Alyssa met me in Re off the train, and we drank a glass of Rosé before biking to Ascona. Had a fun big descent on an exciting narrow road to Ascona. It’s great to feel some warmer weather, though unfortunately we are back in Switzerland, and things are expensive again. Looking forward to getting back into Italy. Had dinner in Ascona/Locarno. It’s a pretty area on Lake Maggiore, but it seems pretty wealthy, old, and a little too sleepy. It would probably be more lively in the peak summer season..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/19/24 - Asconda to Menaggio\nWe stayed at a very nice B&B Borgo with a high-quality breakfast. We had a slow morning enjoying breakfast and walking around Ascona, then headed out on bikes to Lake Como. On the way to Como, we passed through Lugano. This was a bustling city on Lake Lugano. We biked through the old area with insanely steep, cobbled streets. We took the route around the north side of the lake, and it sent us on a beautiful but difficult route. We had spectacular views of the lake, but there was some hiking of bikes up steep staircases. As we reached the north side of the lake, it started raining, and when we got to Porlezza, it was a downpour. We took refuge at an outdoor cafe with a very friendly Italian clerk and had two glasses of wine and antipasto to wait out the rain. By the time we got back on our bikes, it was getting dark, so we had a wet and dark descent to Menaggio to meet Wes and Grant for a very long dinner of pizza and pasta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/20/24 - Explore Lake Como\nDay off in Lake Como. A slow morning with pastries and pizza before hanging out at the one public beach in Menaggio, which was hidden off a tiny path by the campground. We relaxed at the beach and did some bike maintenance before catching a ferry to explore towns across the lake. We got antsy and accidentally took a ferry to Bellagio instead of Varenna. Bellagio had hoards of people and was too fancy for us. Not very memorable. We then took a second ferry to Varenna. Similar hoards of people off the ferry, but we continued south and eventually found a nice, quiet public beach to go swimming. Our only swimming experience of the trip! We then migrated to a nice outdoor cafe in a quiet plaza and drank a couple of glasses of Rosé before catching a late ferry back to Menaggio for dinner. For dinner, we ended up inside drinking a nice bottle of Lugana (from Lake Garda) and listening to Linkin Park. Our waitress was very friendly (as are many Italians).\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/21/24 - Menaggio to Milan, train to florence\nAn ambitious day as we decided to ride 52 miles to Milan and then catch a train to Florence because the weather was better down south. On the bottom of Lake Como, we rode inside a long tunnel for 5 miles and then were on a long path by the freeway to Milan. We fortunately figured out the train to Florence with our bikes and made it last minute. It took us 4.5 hours to get to Florence because assembled bikes have to go on the slow local train. We arrived in Florence and were surprised how lively it was at 10pm. I ate Indian food by the train station, then made it on to Hotel Lorena in the core of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/22/24 - Walk around florence\nIntro day to Florence – Started the day with a paid walking tour of the central city, hearing about the story of the Medici family. Spent the afternoon wandering around the city and ended up at the Piazza Michelangelo with a great view of the city. I got a little burnt out from walking aimlessly today and started feeling like I wanted to go home. But it’s a beautiful city. For dinner, we ate Chinese and sweated our asses off. One of the spiciest dinner experiences of my life. My hair was damp with sweat by the end of the dinner. Insane. The people next to us got a kick out of us sweating. We finished our day with the second gelato of the day.\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/23/24 - Cycle outside florence\nBike outside Florence – Took our bikes for a ride in the hills outside Florence. To Potassieve and then to Fiesole. We considered some wine tasting, but I guess you need reservations and they are very expensive in Tuscany. We’re amateurs. That seems kinda obvious now. We ended up having a glass of boxed Chianti from a community restaurant with a great view in Fiesole, then had a fun descent back into Florence as it started to rain. Chinese food again for dinner as there was a torrential downpour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/24/24 - Florence to Greve in Chianti\nBike to Greve in Chianti from Firenze, staying at the Ancora bed and breakfast. We arrived around 1 after an easy bike ride. Hanging out around the compound in the afternoon. Thinking, staring, drinking coffee and wine. Relaxing with minimal WiFi and zero distractions besides some birds. Rain and clouds moving in and out over us with breaks of blue sky. Purchased a bottle of wine made by the host for 10 euros. Alyssa after 3 glasses of wine – “We can always get another bottle of wine; we are in Chi-cante (chi-cahn-tee) you know.” In the evening, we biked down to the small town of Greve, which has a triangular plaza in the center of town. We found a nice restaurant where we drank complimentary prosecco and then a glass of Chianti – as we were in the home region of Chianti. Unfortunately, I received a plate of porcini pasta with no flavor. After getting gelato, we biked back up the dirt road hill to our B&B. Our host had mentioned that we should keep an eye out for wild boar and that she hopes we don’t encounter one. As we slowly biked up the hill, we kept an eye out; we safely made it home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/25/24 - Cycle back to florence, train to Milan\nWe woke up at the Ancora B&B to a beautifully sunny morning overlooking the Tuscany hills. We enjoyed a communal breakfast with other guests and had a very relaxing morning drinking coffee, reading, journaling, and planning our next travel plans. We bought our train tickets from Florence to Milan and then headed out on our bikes back to Florence. In Florence, we stopped at our favorite restaurant – Pitti Express. It is a small, cheap, and fast-paced restaurant on the south side of the River. Three guys in there rapidly serving a small, delicious menu. This was our second time there. This time we got the same fresh salad, a glass of white wine, and the pesto lasagna. The lasagna was insanely rich and soft – melt-in-your-mouth. We were in a rush, so we decided not to get the tiramisu, which was one of my biggest regrets of the trip. We biked to the train station and made our train after a hot and sweaty loading of our bikes and heavy bags on the train – while helping another older woman with a heavy e-bike get loaded on the train, hoping the train doesn’t take off without us. On the train, we enjoyed some pastries we purchased and thought about what to do in Milan. We made it to the Airbnb in Milan, where we met Grant and Wes for some unique Chinese food in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Staying near the La Fontana neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/26/24 - Explore Milan\nWe spent this day exploring Milan after figuring out which bike shop was going to help us box up our bikes for the flight on Saturday. In the morning, we did some thrift shopping and enjoyed the lively cafe scene in the hip Brera neighborhood. While Alyssa purchased some boots at a vintage store, I drank espresso and ate a delicious focaccia sandwich at ‘Debbies’ while observing all the fashionable and rather beautiful young people at the cafe. I felt out of place in my travel clothes. Lots of women in oversized jeans and blazer jackets. In the afternoon, Wes, Alyssa, and I biked in the rain to Naviglio, where Da Vinci designed a series of canals. Wes got a flat tire during a respite in rain, and then we continued on to the Duomo and the Galleria Vittorio. In the rain, we – and the hoards of others – huddled around the Duomo and walked around the indoor mall at Vittorio. The Duomo is an impressive, intricate building, ala Sagrada Familia. I wonder if humans will ever build any secular structures as impressive and long-lasting that people will be visiting hundreds and thousands of years from now. In the evening, we started with a Negroni and a nice, complimentary antipasto plate at a friendly bar in our neighborhood. We migrated to a nice restaurant where we got delicious pizza and drinks. I got the pistachio mortadella. We accidentally ordered 2 liters of Chianti (we thought maybe they were ‘bottles,’ but they were liters). After the wine, we were given a bucket with 3 bottles of brightly colored liqueurs that we quickly drank (unfortunately). Eventually, they were about to bring us another bucket of liqueurs, but thankfully, I declined. Feeling a little buzzed, we migrated to a bar down the street where we drank a beer on a covered bench on the street corner. We made it back to our lodging and played hearts until midnight (Wes won, as he often did).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/27/24 - Milan\nI woke up somewhat early and went and ate a cheesy ham and olive roll and drank espresso outside at a cafe. We had a slow morning after a late night and then said goodbye to Grant and Wes as they left to bike to Venice. We eventually cleaned up and biked with all our stuff to the bike shop, which had boxes waiting for us in Brera (Rossignolli bike shop). We packed up our bikes in a courtyard in the back of the shop with tools and shipping materials they gave us; we were very grateful to them. After getting our bikes completely boxed, we explored the neighborhood on foot and then found a fancy ramen place for lunch. At this point, Alyssa was clearly hungover, and I was just a little tired. After ramen, we immediately got gelato. I got mint, which was delicious, fresh, and had individual pieces of mint in it – nothing like mint ice cream I’ve ever had. Within 30 minutes of the gelato, I started feeling ill. We ordered a large Uber van to transport us and our bikes to the hotel we were staying at closer to the airport. By the time we got to the hotel, I felt pretty bad and vomited within 10 minutes of arriving. This started a very rough 24 hours for us. That night I was able to sleep maybe 1-2 hours, and I don’t think Alyssa slept. I had the body aches and a terrible stomach, and Alyssa was visiting the bathroom every 30 minutes. It was a rough way to end our trip. It’s unclear whether we got food poisoning or not (or whether it was the Negroni and colorful liqueurs).\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n9/28/24 - Milan to SF to Tahoe\nWe woke up at 3am after not sleeping and took a ride to the airport. We needed to check our large boxes, but the ITA checking stalls didn’t open for another hour, so we lay on the floor, still feeling terrible. Eventually, we checked our bags after having to run around the check-in area, wrapping our bags in plastic and dropping them off in obscure, distant large luggage areas. The pushing of large boxes actually made me feel a little better. Being sick, we were very concerned about getting on an 11-hour flight, but we had no choice. The flight went relatively well, and we made it out of Italy. It was one of the longest flights I’ve been on, and for half the flight, I felt pretty terrible. But we made it out alive. We arrived in SF, got our car, and did the 4-hour drive back to Tahoe. We were happy to be home – and see Uni. What a long and difficult 24 hours…"

    "text": "In February, I traveled to the Japan with a group of friends from Tahoe. We traveled to both Hokkaido and Honshu for an enjoyable combination of skiing and enjoying the culture that Japan has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n2/13/25 - Tahoe to SF\nDrove from Tahoe to our sf airport hotel the day before our flight. It was a downpour as an atmospheric river headed towards Tahoe.\n\n\n2/14/25 - SF to Tokyo to Sapporo\nAlyssa and I met Marlon and Justine at SFO and flew straight to Tokyo then caught a connecting flight to Sapporo. From Sapporo airport we caught a train to downtown Sapporo to end at our traditional Japanese inn (ryokan). A very long day of travel. Our ryokan is Nakamuraya Ryokan. It’s a large room with 4 futons on the floor and no shoes allowed. The ryokan had a modest onsen with a single pool. In the lobby there is a smoking room that is essentially a glass telephone booth.\n\n\n\n …\n\n …\n\n\n\n2/15/25 - Ski Sapporo Teine\nStarted the day with a traditional Japanese breakfast. 5-10 small dishes consisting of fish, soy products, pickled veggies and some other mystery food. After breakfast we picked up the rental van - which is the size of a hatchback in the USA and headed to ski Sapporo Teine. Blue bird day with epic views of the city and the Sea of Japan. Wind turbines off shore. In the trees and side country we found some great pockets of left over deep, soft, light snow. Delicious miso ramen in the lodge at lunch. Right after skiing we headed to Teine onsen Honoka, a bustling, enormous public onsen. One of the coolest experiences I’ve had. Although there are a ton of people it is still a relaxing, nice experience because people are generally quiet (though some do have muted conversations) and very respectful of the onsen rules and to others. Clearly a great culture of onsen that makes a bustling onsen still feel very enjoyable. I think hakujins have an image of an onsen being a serene place where they get peace and solidarity. But the local onsen where are actually very busy though somehow it still feels peaceful. Even in the sauna with the tv playing (low volume) it is peaceful. They have a way of creating a peaceful experience in a busy, Japanese way. Dozens or hundreds of men cycling through 5-10 different pools of different temperatures. An enormous dry sauna (I couldn’t see the heat source but it appeared to be wood fired with a huge compartment of rocks, it is truly dry though, no water on the rocks ) with 4 levels of benches and a tv playing anime. The small towel that you use in the sauna can be used to cover up your private parts and people put them on their heads to regulate heat like a sauna hat. You can just use a small wet towel instead of a sauna hat.The benches are covered towels and then you bring in a small seat pad that you rinse with water when you leave. Everyone is naked which was a new experience. We had to cover up Marlon’s tattoo because they are forbidden. After the sauna we dressed in our robe like shorts and top and headed to the restaurant inside the onsen building and had some refreshments. In the steam room sits a bowl of salt that users can take scoops of and rub all over your body. In the sauna multiple hourglass timers on the wall so multiple people can keep track of their time in the sauna. A water massage area where a two strong streams of water come down on your shoulders and back. Really fun experience. We headed back to Sapporo and ended up at a bustling izakaya food stall market under the train. The building shook every time a train would pass. Ate an assortment of food including nagiri fried chicken sushi. A full day of fun.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/16/25 - Ski Shirabetsu\nNo snow forecasters so we headed south to do a ski tour at Shirabetsu and to meet Nick Zoe and Jared. On the way, stopped at 7-11 for breakfast and lunch snacks, consisting of various rice and fish based balls pouches and sandwiches. Very weird weather and temps when we arrived. The mountain is encased in fog and as we ascended realized that the snow had warmed significantly and was pretty mushy. Met our friends near the summit and enjoyed some soft and mushy turns. Got a beer at nearby rusutsu resort. Large touristy resort. Got back to the Sapporo and did a quick onsen before dinner. Headed to ramen alley and checked out all the different ramen options. Waited for awhile then found a tiny, 8 person vendor with one guy serving great ramen. After dinner we wondered the city. Discovered the underground network of heated pathways ( it’s cold outside). There are a ton of businesses that are only accessed in the underground paths. Eventually discovered the bustling “times square of Sapporo”. It’s a big bustling city, we just happen to be staying in a quiet location.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n\n\n2/17/25 - Explore Sapporo\nOur last day in Sapporo before we made a change in plans and decided to go to otaru to chase the powder. We explored Sapporo for most the day. Breakfast sandwich, matcha, ice cream (milk flavored soft serve which is ubiquitous). The highlight was nijo fish market where we had a great lunch of fresh seafood. Uni, unagi, crab, oysters, and scallops and sake. We stumbled upon a matcha tasting room where we learned about matcha from a friendly woman. People ate incredibly friendly here. We ended the day in otaru where we met our friends at our airbnb which is a cozy house with bunk beds.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/18/25 - Ski Kiroro\nWe spent the day at Kiroro ski resort. Powder day. The resort has some fun short steep pitches that funnel out into flatter areas. We enjoyed a long lunch of sake beer and soft serve. After skiing we went straight to Yunohana onsen otaru. It was very similar to the public onsen in Sapporo but a little smaller and less people. But overall very similar. We bought the onsen and meal combo ticket and had soba noodles on the floor after wards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/19/25 - Ski Sapporo Teine\nFull on powder day at Sapporo Teine ski resort. Snowing all day with constant free refills. A true japow day. So much fun with everyone. No lift lines. We rode a single lift all day that gifts you access to a diversity of fun terrain. Teine is a great small resort. It felt like a pretty special day. After skiing a full day we drove to La vista Furano hills hotel which was kind of a culture shock arriving. Lots of gringos/anjins/hakujins arriving and im the lobby. It’s a big nice hotel but also rather affordable. We immediately enjoyed the hotel onsen on the rooftop which looks directly at the ski resort. Onsen is small but very nice with multiple pools of different temperatures and a sauna. Seems like all saunas in Japan have tvs. This one plays the news which is interesting ( though hard to understand). You get two towels, one small one for using in the onsen and one for drying off. Once you shower (at the small individual washing station) you dry off and put on your pajama looking shorts and shirt. It’s an incredibly nice experience. Finished the day with a nice group dinner eating an assorted of sashimi, grilled meats.\n …\n\n\n\n\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/20/25 - Ski Furanodake\nFurano dake backcountry ski day with Nick Zoe and Jared after dropping Marlon and Justine off at the asihakawa airport. Gorgeous sunny morning driving in the snowy farmland north of Furano. So beautiful. Unfortunately we couldn’t find any breakfast in the area at 8am so we ate at 711 and got snacks for the day. I ate a warm pork bun and h and cheese sandwich for breakfast. We started ascending around 945 with other hakujins around. The ascent was serene with sun and soft snow until we gained the ridge and got into the alpine. Quickly it became windy and incredibly cold. We ascendes through a steep section on wind affected snow to gain the false summit. Wind was howling and everyone was freezing but the views were amazing. Really big beautiful mountains in Daisetsuzan National Park. We descended away from the wind on a protected glade and had some great sunny pow turns. It hadn’t snowed a large amount in a while so we weren’t expecting pow turns but we got them! On the mountain we saw several snowy hares. At one point I was descending on my split board and was essentially chasing a snowy hare a few hundred feet in front of me. On the drive down the mountain I saw a fox and an elk. After skiing we went to fukiage outdoor hot spring. A natural hot spring in the woods right off the road. There were about a 5-10 other skiers and tourists enjoying the beautiful setting. Very lovely. I imagine there are many other hidden outdoor, natural hot spring pools around Japan. Talked to some other bc skiers from Boise. Headed back to Furano and ate delicious curry soup with chicken and vegetables. I didn’t know Japan specialized in curry but it was really good. An incredible and unexpected day.\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/21/25 - Furano Rest Day\nRest day in Furano. Zoe and Nick took off and we hung with Jared for the day. Did a few laps at Furano ski resort in marginal snow conditions but really fun looking resort and would love to come back on a pow day. Tried some local bakeries which are great, ate some lavender soft serve, enjoyed the onsen and finished the day with at a local spot with good cheap soba noodles.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/22/25 - Furano to Kyoto\nTravel and rest day (from skiing). Slept in and journaled on the 9th floor lounge while drinking coffee and complimentary probiotic milk drink. Packed up our stuff and arranged with the front desk to have our bags shipped and stored at the airport for a week through black cat. Before dropping the car off we stopped at Eniwaonsen honako in Chitose for an hour or two. Great local onsen with a variety of pools inside and outside with a nice view of a natural treed area. Very peaceful looking out to the sunny ski and snow covered landscape. The highlight of this onsen was a sauna experience I had, which included a guide (employee) from the onsen. When I walked in the sauna I was a little confused because there were people in the sauna but the door was open. I just assumed that maybe they liked it a little cooler which was unfortunate. But I was very wrong. After 5 minutes a man came in and closed the door and provided cups with ice to everyone in the sauna. He then proceeded to douse the large collection of sauna rocks with water, which increased the feeling of heat immediately. There were about a dozen people in the room on two levels of benches with a tv of course. After thoroughly hitting the rocks with water the “guide” ( need to see if there is a Japanese word for this role) brought out a large fan and proceeded to fan the warm air in the room vigorously. This action increased the feeling of heat immensely. He cycles around the room waving the fan in front of every person multiple times. This created a feeling of heat I haven’t experienced before. Extremely hot. So hot that at one point my skin felt very uncomfortable, akin to burning skin. After several cycles of this he started chanting and everyone else followed him in this chant. I wish I knew what they were saying but I would assume it was a chant about withstanding the intense heat that was being created. At one point he looked at me and asked if I was ok - because I assume I looked like I might pass out. Eventually the chanting and fanning of heat stopped and I exited the sauna directly into the cold plunge. Intense but exciting cultural experience. After the onsen Alyssa and I sat in a chair that vibrated your legs for a bit and then ate some ice cream. I bought a sauna hat. Great onsen experience. Flew to Osaka, shuttle to terminal 1, train to Kyoto, taxi to hotel. Ready for bed.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/23/25 - Kyoto Day 1\nDay 1 in Kyoto. Spent the morning exploring the west side of the city at the bamboo forest and okochi sanso garden. The garden was wonderful. We enjoyed walking a solitary pathway with beautiful landscaping, small shrines, and views of the city. We found a small house overlooking a quiet rock garden and enjoyed a meditative experience. We finished the gardens with a complimentary free tea and we tasted matcha, sencha, and genmaicha. Very enjoyable experience right beyond the crowds of the bamboo forest. We then continued on to walk around the area of the Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street. Lovely architecture with residential houses and shops and other temples. We ate lunch and then headed to nishiki market and the shopping district. We spent some time in uniqlo and Alyssa picked up some clothes. We migrated to happy hour at a French bar the Charneau’s recommended near the canals by gion, then head Thai dinner. Full day.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n …\n\n\n\n2/24/25 - Kyoto Day 2\nExplored kyoto. Fushimi inari shrine was very fun. Beautiful views of the city towards the bottom and then we we reached the summit it was a full on snowy blizzard. Went to Kiyomizudera overcrowded shrine in the afternoon followed by Sake tasting and then conveyor belt sushi for dinner.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2/25/25 - Kyoto to Tokyo\nShinkansen bullet train from Kyoto to Tokyo. Met up for a drink at Brian’s restaurant in shibuya. Walked cat Ave through harajuku. Met up with Marlon for yakatori in omoide yokocho. Wondered shinjuku for the evening.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/26/25 - Tokyo Day 1\nSend off Alyssa. Tired and slightly hung over. First thing, metropolitan building 45 floor observatory for panaramic view of Tokyo. For such a big city, air quality seems surprisingly good. A few large parks/green spaces but seems to be a lack of parks or public spaces for people to relax in public. Asakusa neighborhood and sensuji shrine. The whole neighborhood was destroyed during the infamous Tokyo Great Air raids where 10k people were killed. Jimbocho neighborhood and boom street with a delicious bahn mi. A night out with Paul Jenna and Marlon in golden gai. Eating late night tempera noodles. Checked into the capsule hotel (Anshin oyoda shinjuku) and took a sauna. 4 person sauna. Incredible hot like all Japan saunas, around 200 degrees.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/27/25 - Tokyo Day 2\nDay with Marlon. Tired and hung over from late night with Paul and Jenna TeamLab planets in the am. Really fun interactive art and technology space. Went to Thermae yu onsen in shinjuku. Brief “aroma time” where a guy comes in and throws water and aroma on rocks and fans the room briefly. Carbonated pool (1000 ppm) which supposedly provides health benefits. Very relaxing lay down pool were you are laying on the ground in about 6 inches of hot water. Half your body is submerged the other half exposed to air. Gives a sensory deprivation type feel. This one was more expensive at 20$. Explores the quieter “suburb” of shimokitazawa. Got keema curry vegetables right off the train. Vintage, expensive thrift stores literally everywhere selling 1990s American clothing like old college sweatshirts and 90s cultural Tshirts for surprisingly high prices. Found a very nice shared use path through lovely quiet neighborhoods. This seems like a great place to live. Quiet with nice architecture. Gives off a modern, traditional Japanese feel. Great matcha ice cream. Found a traditional style restaurant on the 8th floor at night to eat a meal of small mixed plates, sashimi, udon, tempura, rice, etc.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/28/25 - Tokyo Day 3\nEating complimentary Keema curry and rice breakfast in the capsule hotel lounge and journaling with coffee. Seems like a lot of people are coughing. Kinda feels like an infermery. Do people cough a lot in Japan in general or is it just this hotel? All saunas in Japan have a large wood or ceramic plate hanging above the heater. It seems like it’s to protect the ceiling from heat/steam and or to distribute heat steam throughout the room.\n …\n …\n\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n3/1/25 - Tokyo to SF to Tahoe\nWalked around in Shinjuku in the morning looking for souvenirs, no luck. Ate some chicken skin skewers from a market as we took the train to narita airport. Ate some spicy ramen and macha soft serve at the airport before our 9 hour flight back to san francisco."

    "text": "In February, I traveled to the Japan with a group of friends from Tahoe. We traveled to both Hokkaido and Honshu for an enjoyable combination of skiing and enjoying the culture that Japan has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n2/13/25 - Tahoe to SF\nDrove from Tahoe to our sf airport hotel the day before our flight. It was a downpour as an atmospheric river headed towards Tahoe.\n\n\n2/14/25 - SF to Tokyo to Sapporo\nAlyssa and I met Marlon and Justine at SFO and flew straight to Tokyo then caught a connecting flight to Sapporo. From Sapporo airport we caught a train to downtown Sapporo to end at our traditional Japanese inn (ryokan). A very long day of travel. Our ryokan is Nakamuraya Ryokan. It’s a large room with 4 futons on the floor and no shoes allowed. The ryokan had a modest onsen with a single pool. In the lobby there is a smoking room that is essentially a glass telephone booth.\n\n\n\n …\n\n …\n\n\n\n2/15/25 - Ski Sapporo Teine\nStarted the day with a traditional Japanese breakfast. 5-10 small dishes consisting of fish, soy products, pickled veggies and some other mystery food. After breakfast we picked up the rental van - which is the size of a hatchback in the USA and headed to ski Sapporo Teine. Blue bird day with epic views of the city and the Sea of Japan. Wind turbines off shore. In the trees and side country we found some great pockets of left over deep, soft, light snow. Delicious miso ramen in the lodge at lunch. Right after skiing we headed to Teine onsen Honoka, a bustling, enormous public onsen. One of the coolest experiences I’ve had. Although there are a ton of people it is still a relaxing, nice experience because people are generally quiet (though some do have muted conversations) and very respectful of the onsen rules and to others. Clearly a great culture of onsen that makes a bustling onsen still feel very enjoyable. I think hakujins have an image of an onsen being a serene place where they get peace and solidarity. But the local onsen where are actually very busy though somehow it still feels peaceful. Even in the sauna with the tv playing (low volume) it is peaceful. They have a way of creating a peaceful experience in a busy, Japanese way. Dozens or hundreds of men cycling through 5-10 different pools of different temperatures. An enormous dry sauna (I couldn’t see the heat source but it appeared to be wood fired with a huge compartment of rocks, it is truly dry though, no water on the rocks ) with 4 levels of benches and a tv playing anime. The small towel that you use in the sauna can be used to cover up your private parts and people put them on their heads to regulate heat like a sauna hat. You can just use a small wet towel instead of a sauna hat.The benches are covered towels and then you bring in a small seat pad that you rinse with water when you leave. Everyone is naked which was a new experience. We had to cover up Marlon’s tattoo because they are forbidden. After the sauna we dressed in our robe like shorts and top and headed to the restaurant inside the onsen building and had some refreshments. In the steam room sits a bowl of salt that users can take scoops of and rub all over your body. In the sauna multiple hourglass timers on the wall so multiple people can keep track of their time in the sauna. A water massage area where a two strong streams of water come down on your shoulders and back. Really fun experience. We headed back to Sapporo and ended up at a bustling izakaya food stall market under the train. The building shook every time a train would pass. Ate an assortment of food including nagiri fried chicken sushi. A full day of fun.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/16/25 - Ski Shirabetsu\nNo snow forecasters so we headed south to do a ski tour at Shirabetsu and to meet Nick Zoe and Jared. On the way, stopped at 7-11 for breakfast and lunch snacks, consisting of various rice and fish based balls pouches and sandwiches. Very weird weather and temps when we arrived. The mountain is encased in fog and as we ascended realized that the snow had warmed significantly and was pretty mushy. Met our friends near the summit and enjoyed some soft and mushy turns. Got a beer at nearby rusutsu resort. Large touristy resort. Got back to the Sapporo and did a quick onsen before dinner. Headed to ramen alley and checked out all the different ramen options. Waited for awhile then found a tiny, 8 person vendor with one guy serving great ramen. After dinner we wondered the city. Discovered the underground network of heated pathways ( it’s cold outside). There are a ton of businesses that are only accessed in the underground paths. Eventually discovered the bustling “times square of Sapporo”. It’s a big bustling city, we just happen to be staying in a quiet location.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n\n\n2/17/25 - Explore Sapporo\nOur last day in Sapporo before we made a change in plans and decided to go to otaru to chase the powder. We explored Sapporo for most the day. Breakfast sandwich, matcha, ice cream (milk flavored soft serve which is ubiquitous). The highlight was nijo fish market where we had a great lunch of fresh seafood. Uni, unagi, crab, oysters, and scallops and sake. We stumbled upon a matcha tasting room where we learned about matcha from a friendly woman. People ate incredibly friendly here. We ended the day in otaru where we met our friends at our airbnb which is a cozy house with bunk beds.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/18/25 - Ski Kiroro\nWe spent the day at Kiroro ski resort. Powder day. The resort has some fun short steep pitches that funnel out into flatter areas. We enjoyed a long lunch of sake beer and soft serve. After skiing we went straight to Yunohana onsen otaru. It was very similar to the public onsen in Sapporo but a little smaller and less people. But overall very similar. We bought the onsen and meal combo ticket and had soba noodles on the floor after wards.\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n …\n\n\n\n2/19/25 - Ski Sapporo Teine\nFull on powder day at Sapporo Teine ski resort. Snowing all day with constant free refills. A true japow day. So much fun with everyone. No lift lines. We rode a single lift all day that gifts you access to a diversity of fun terrain. Teine is a great small resort. It felt like a pretty special day. After skiing a full day we drove to La vista Furano hills hotel which was kind of a culture shock arriving.
