<h1><strong>2/14/25 - SF to Tokyo to Sapporo</strong></h1>
<p>Alyssa and I met Marlon and Justine at SFO and flew straight to Tokyo then caught a connecting flight to Sapporo. From Sapporo airport we caught a train to downtown Sapporo to end at our traditional Japanese inn (ryokan). A very long day of travel. Our ryokan is Nakamuraya Ryokan. It’s a large room with 4 futons on the floor and no shoes allowed. The ryokan had a modest onsen with a single pool. In the lobby there is a smoking room that is essentially a glass telephone booth.</p>

<h1><strong>2/15/25 - Ski Sapporo Teine</strong></h1>
<p>Started the day with a traditional Japanese breakfast. 5-10 small dishes consisting of fish, soy products, pickled veggies and some other mystery food. After breakfast we picked up the rental van - which is the size of a hatchback in the USA and headed to ski Sapporo Teine. Blue bird day with epic views of the city and the Sea of Japan. Wind turbines off shore. In the trees and side country we found some great pockets of left over deep, soft, light snow. Delicious miso ramen in the lodge at lunch. Right after skiing we headed to Teine onsen Honoka, a bustling, enormous public onsen. One of the coolest experiences I’ve had. Although there are a ton of people it is still a relaxing, nice experience because people are generally quiet (though some do have muted conversations) and very respectful of the onsen rules and to others. Clearly a great culture of onsen that makes a bustling onsen still feel very enjoyable. I think hakujins have an image of an onsen being a serene place where they get peace and solidarity. But the local onsen where are actually very busy though somehow it still feels peaceful. Even in the sauna with the tv playing (low volume) it is peaceful. They have a way of creating a peaceful experience in a busy, Japanese way. Dozens or hundreds of men cycling through 5-10 different pools of different temperatures. An enormous dry sauna (I couldn’t see the heat source but it appeared to be wood fired with a huge compartment of rocks, it is truly dry though, no water on the rocks ) with 4 levels of benches and a tv playing anime. The small towel that you use in the sauna can be used to cover up your private parts and people put them on their heads to regulate heat like a sauna hat. You can just use a small wet towel instead of a sauna hat.The benches are covered towels and then you bring in a small seat pad that you rinse with water when you leave. Everyone is naked which was a new experience. We had to cover up Marlon’s tattoo because they are forbidden. After the sauna we dressed in our robe like shorts and top and headed to the restaurant inside the onsen building and had some refreshments. In the steam room sits a bowl of salt that users can take scoops of and rub all over your body. In the sauna multiple hourglass timers on the wall so multiple people can keep track of their time in the sauna. A water massage area where a two strong streams of water come down on your shoulders and back. Really fun experience. We headed back to Sapporo and ended up at a bustling izakaya food stall market under the train. The building shook every time a train would pass. Ate an assortment of food including nagiri fried chicken sushi. A full day of fun.</p>

<h1><strong>2/16/25 - Ski Shirabetsu</strong></h1>
<p>No snow forecasters so we headed south to do a ski tour at Shirabetsu and to meet Nick Zoe and Jared. On the way, stopped at 7-11 for breakfast and lunch snacks, consisting of various rice and fish based balls pouches and sandwiches. Very weird weather and temps when we arrived. The mountain is encased in fog and as we ascended realized that the snow had warmed significantly and was pretty mushy. Met our friends near the summit and enjoyed some soft and mushy turns. Got a beer at nearby rusutsu resort. Large touristy resort. Got back to the Sapporo and did a quick onsen before dinner. Headed to ramen alley and checked out all the different ramen options. Waited for awhile then found a tiny, 8 person vendor with one guy serving great ramen. After dinner we wondered the city. Discovered the underground network of heated pathways ( it’s cold outside). There are a ton of businesses that are only accessed in the underground paths. Eventually discovered the bustling “times square of Sapporo”. It’s a big bustling city, we just happen to be staying in a quiet location.</p>

<h1><strong>2/17/25 - Explore Sapporo</strong></h1>
<p>Our last day in Sapporo before we made a change in plans and decided to go to otaru to chase the powder. We explored Sapporo for most the day. Breakfast sandwich, matcha, ice cream (milk flavored soft serve which is ubiquitous). The highlight was nijo fish market where we had a great lunch of fresh seafood. Uni, unagi, crab, oysters, and scallops and sake. We stumbled upon a matcha tasting room where we learned about matcha from a friendly woman. People ate incredibly friendly here. We ended the day in otaru where we met our friends at our airbnb which is a cozy house with bunk beds.</p>

<h1><strong>2/18/25 - Ski Kiroro</strong></h1>
<p>We spent the day at Kiroro ski resort. Powder day. The resort has some fun short steep pitches that funnel out into flatter areas. We enjoyed a long lunch of sake beer and soft serve. After skiing we went straight to Yunohana onsen otaru. It was very similar to the public onsen in Sapporo but a little smaller and less people. But overall very similar. We bought the onsen and meal combo ticket and had soba noodles on the floor after wards.</p>

<h1><strong>2/19/25 - Ski Sapporo Teine</strong></h1>
<p>Full on powder day at Sapporo Teine ski resort. Snowing all day with constant free refills. A true japow day. So much fun with everyone. No lift lines. We rode a single lift all day that gifts you access to a diversity of fun terrain. Teine is a great small resort. It felt like a pretty special day. After skiing a full day we drove to La vista Furano hills hotel which was kind of a culture shock arriving. Lots of gringos/anjins/hakujins arriving and im the lobby. It’s a big nice hotel but also rather affordable. We immediately enjoyed the hotel onsen on the rooftop which looks directly at the ski resort. Onsen is small but very nice with multiple pools of different temperatures and a sauna. Seems like all saunas in Japan have tvs. This one plays the news which is interesting ( though hard to understand). You get two towels, one small one for using in the onsen and one for drying off. Once you shower (at the small individual washing station) you dry off and put on your pajama looking shorts and shirt. It’s an incredibly nice experience. Finished the day with a nice group dinner eating an assorted of sashimi, grilled meats.</p>

<h1><strong>2/20/25 - Ski Furanodake</strong></h1>
<p>Furano dake backcountry ski day with Nick Zoe and Jared after dropping Marlon and Justine off at the asihakawa airport. Gorgeous sunny morning driving in the snowy farmland north of Furano. So beautiful. Unfortunately we couldn’t find any breakfast in the area at 8am so we ate at 711 and got snacks for the day. I ate a warm pork bun and h and cheese sandwich for breakfast. We started ascending around 945 with other hakujins around. The ascent was serene with sun and soft snow until we gained the ridge and got into the alpine. Quickly it became windy and incredibly cold. We ascendes through a steep section on wind affected snow to gain the false summit. Wind was howling and everyone was freezing but the views were amazing. Really big beautiful mountains in Daisetsuzan National Park. We descended away from the wind on a protected glade and had some great sunny pow turns. It hadn’t snowed a large amount in a while so we weren’t expecting pow turns but we got them! On the mountain we saw several snowy hares. At one point I was descending on my split board and was essentially chasing a snowy hare a few hundred feet in front of me. On the drive down the mountain I saw a fox and an elk. After skiing we went to fukiage outdoor hot spring. A natural hot spring in the woods right off the road. There were about a 5-10 other skiers and tourists enjoying the beautiful setting. Very lovely. I imagine there are many other hidden outdoor, natural hot spring pools around Japan. Talked to some other bc skiers from Boise. Headed back to Furano and ate delicious curry soup with chicken and vegetables. I didn’t know Japan specialized in curry but it was really good. An incredible and unexpected day.</p>

<p>Rest day in Furano. Zoe and Nick took off and we hung with Jared for the day. Did a few laps at Furano ski resort in marginal snow conditions but really fun looking resort and would love to come back on a pow day. Tried some local bakeries which are great, ate some lavender soft serve, enjoyed the onsen and finished the day with at a local spot with good cheap soba noodles.</p>

<h1><strong>2/22/25 - Furano to Kyoto</strong></h1>
<p>Travel and rest day (from skiing). Slept in and journaled on the 9th floor lounge while drinking coffee and complimentary probiotic milk drink. Packed up our stuff and arranged with the front desk to have our bags shipped and stored at the airport for a week through black cat. Before dropping the car off we stopped at Eniwaonsen honako in Chitose for an hour or two. Great local onsen with a variety of pools inside and outside with a nice view of a natural treed area. Very peaceful looking out to the sunny ski and snow covered landscape. The highlight of this onsen was a sauna experience I had, which included a guide (employee) from the onsen. When I walked in the sauna I was a little confused because there were people in the sauna but the door was open. I just assumed that maybe they liked it a little cooler which was unfortunate. But I was very wrong. After 5 minutes a man came in and closed the door and provided cups with ice to everyone in the sauna. He then proceeded to douse the large collection of sauna rocks with water, which increased the feeling of heat immediately. There were about a dozen people in the room on two levels of benches with a tv of course. After thoroughly hitting the rocks with water the “guide” ( need to see if there is a Japanese word for this role) brought out a large fan and proceeded to fan the warm air in the room vigorously. This action increased the feeling of heat immensely. He cycles around the room waving the fan in front of every person multiple times. This created a feeling of heat I haven’t experienced before. Extremely hot. So hot that at one point my skin felt very uncomfortable, akin to burning skin. After several cycles of this he started chanting and everyone else followed him in this chant. I wish I knew what they were saying but I would assume it was a chant about withstanding the intense heat that was being created. At one point he looked at me and asked if I was ok - because I assume I looked like I might pass out. Eventually the chanting and fanning of heat stopped and I exited the sauna directly into the cold plunge. Intense but exciting cultural experience. After the onsen Alyssa and I sat in a chair that vibrated your legs for a bit and then ate some ice cream. I bought a sauna hat. Great onsen experience. Flew to Osaka, shuttle to terminal 1, train to Kyoto, taxi to hotel. Ready for bed.</p>

<h1><strong>2/23/25 - Kyoto Day 1</strong></h1>
<p>Day 1 in Kyoto. Spent the morning exploring the west side of the city at the bamboo forest and okochi sanso garden. The garden was wonderful. We enjoyed walking a solitary pathway with beautiful landscaping, small shrines, and views of the city. We found a small house overlooking a quiet rock garden and enjoyed a meditative experience. We finished the gardens with a complimentary free tea and we tasted matcha, sencha, and genmaicha. Very enjoyable experience right beyond the crowds of the bamboo forest. We then continued on to walk around the area of the Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street. Lovely architecture with residential houses and shops and other temples. We ate lunch and then headed to nishiki market and the shopping district. We spent some time in uniqlo and Alyssa picked up some clothes. We migrated to happy hour at a French bar the Charneau’s recommended near the canals by gion, then head Thai dinner. Full day.</p>

<h1><strong>2/24/25 - Kyoto Day 2</strong></h1>
<p>Explored kyoto. Fushimi inari shrine was very fun. Beautiful views of the city towards the bottom and then we we reached the summit it was a full on snowy blizzard. Went to Kiyomizudera overcrowded shrine in the afternoon followed by Sake tasting and then conveyor belt sushi for dinner.</p>

<h1><strong>2/26/25 - Tokyo Day 1</strong></h1>
<p>Send off Alyssa. Tired and slightly hung over. First thing, metropolitan building 45 floor observatory for panaramic view of Tokyo. For such a big city, air quality seems surprisingly good. A few large parks/green spaces but seems to be a lack of parks or public spaces for people to relax in public. Asakusa neighborhood and sensuji shrine. The whole neighborhood was destroyed during the infamous Tokyo Great Air raids where 10k people were killed. Jimbocho neighborhood and boom street with a delicious bahn mi. A night out with Paul Jenna and Marlon in golden gai. Eating late night tempera noodles. Checked into the capsule hotel (Anshin oyoda shinjuku) and took a sauna. 4 person sauna. Incredible hot like all Japan saunas, around 200 degrees.</p>

<h1><strong>2/27/25 - Tokyo Day 2</strong></h1>
<p>Day with Marlon. Tired and hung over from late night with Paul and Jenna TeamLab planets in the am. Really fun interactive art and technology space. Went to Thermae yu onsen in shinjuku. Brief “aroma time” where a guy comes in and throws water and aroma on rocks and fans the room briefly. Carbonated pool (1000 ppm) which supposedly provides health benefits. Very relaxing lay down pool were you are laying on the ground in about 6 inches of hot water. Half your body is submerged the other half exposed to air. Gives a sensory deprivation type feel. This one was more expensive at 20$. Explores the quieter “suburb” of shimokitazawa. Got keema curry vegetables right off the train. Vintage, expensive thrift stores literally everywhere selling 1990s American clothing like old college sweatshirts and 90s cultural Tshirts for surprisingly high prices. Found a very nice shared use path through lovely quiet neighborhoods. This seems like a great place to live. Quiet with nice architecture. Gives off a modern, traditional Japanese feel. Great matcha ice cream. Found a traditional style restaurant on the 8th floor at night to eat a meal of small mixed plates, sashimi, udon, tempura, rice, etc.</p>

<h1><strong>2/28/25 - Tokyo Day 3</strong></h1>
<p>Eating complimentary Keema curry and rice breakfast in the capsule hotel lounge and journaling with coffee. Seems like a lot of people are coughing. Kinda feels like an infermery. Do people cough a lot in Japan in general or is it just this hotel? All saunas in Japan have a large wood or ceramic plate hanging above the heater. It seems like it’s to protect the ceiling from heat/steam and or to distribute heat steam throughout the room.</p>

<h1><strong>3/1/25 - Tokyo to SF to Tahoe</strong></h1>
<p>Walked around in Shinjuku in the morning looking for souvenirs, no luck. Ate some chicken skin skewers from a market as we took the train to narita airport. Ate some spicy ramen and macha soft serve at the airport before our 9 hour flight back to san francisco.</p>
